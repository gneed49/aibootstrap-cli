# Prompt — implement a feature
Context: you are the agent, pairing on delivery. Work from the spec; no improvisation.

## Inputs to give the agent
- Read: `context/project_context.template.md`, `context/constraints.template.md` (if filled), `context/agent_tools.template.md`, `rules/*`.
- Read the spec: `specs/spec.<name>.md` (Feature section).
- Read the relevant code files: `...`.
- List potential impacts briefly (API, data, UI).

## Task
1) Summarize the request and acceptance criteria in 3 bullets.
2) Propose a mini plan (3–5 steps) and confirm it.
3) Implement with minimal scope.
4) Add/adjust necessary tests.
5) Update docs if relevant.

## Expected output
- Concise summary of changes.
- Files modified.
- Test command(s) run and results.
- Next steps or remaining risks.
